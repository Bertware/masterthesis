	abstract     = {As the Web of Data is growing at an ever increasing speed, the lack of reliable query solutions for live public data becomes apparent. SPARQL implementations have matured and deliver impressive performance for public SPARQL endpoints, yet poor availability-especially under high loads-prevents their use in real-world applications. We propose to tackle this availability problem by defining triple pattern fragments, a specific kind of Linked Data Fragments that enable low-cost publication of queryable data by moving intelligence from the server to the client. This paper formalizes the Linked Data Fragments concept, introduces a client-side SPARQL query processing algorithm that uses a dynamic iterator pipeline, and verifies servers' availability under load. The results indicate that, at the cost of lower performance, query techniques with triple pattern fragments lead to high availability, thereby allowing for reliable applications on top of public, queryable Linked Data.},

	abstract={This paper studies the problem of computing optimal journeys in dynamic public transit networks. We introduce a novel algorithmic framework, called Connection Scan Algorithm (CSA), to compute journeys. It organizes data as a single array of connections, which it scans once per query. Despite its simplicity, our algorithm is very versatile. We use it to solve earliest arrival and multi-criteria profile queries. Moreover, we extend it to handle the minimum expected arrival time (MEAT) problem, which incorporates stochastic delays on the vehicles and asks for a set of (alternative) journeys that in its entirety minimizes the user's expected arrival time at the destination. Our experiments on the dense metropolitan network of London show that CSA computes MEAT queries, our most complex scenario, in 272 ms on average.",

Two main approaches that transform the problems into shortest path problems are reviewed, including issues like the modeling of realistic details (e.g., train transfers) and further optimization criteria (e.g., the number of transfers). An important topic is also multi-criteria optimization, where in general all attractive connections with respect to several criteria shall be determined. Finally, we discuss the performance of the described algorithms, which is crucial for their application in a real system.",

Using the extended service‐quality model developed by Zeithaml, Berry, and Parasuraman (Journal of Marketing, 52, 35–48) as a conceptual framework, five specific propositions implied by the model and by earlier studies contributing to its development were tested. Such testing required a complex research design involving five service companies as well as samples of customers, contact employees, and managers from each company. The results have practical implications and suggest an agenda for future organizational research.}
