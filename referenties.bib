@inproceedings{verborgh14,
	abstract     = {As the Web of Data is growing at an ever increasing speed, the lack of reliable query solutions for live public data becomes apparent. SPARQL implementations have matured and deliver impressive performance for public SPARQL endpoints, yet poor availability-especially under high loads-prevents their use in real-world applications. We propose to tackle this availability problem by defining triple pattern fragments, a specific kind of Linked Data Fragments that enable low-cost publication of queryable data by moving intelligence from the server to the client. This paper formalizes the Linked Data Fragments concept, introduces a client-side SPARQL query processing algorithm that uses a dynamic iterator pipeline, and verifies servers' availability under load. The results indicate that, at the cost of lower performance, query techniques with triple pattern fragments lead to high availability, thereby allowing for reliable applications on top of public, queryable Linked Data.},

	abstract={This paper studies the problem of computing optimal journeys in dynamic public transit networks. We introduce a novel algorithmic framework, called Connection Scan Algorithm (CSA), to compute journeys. It organizes data as a single array of connections, which it scans once per query. Despite its simplicity, our algorithm is very versatile. We use it to solve earliest arrival and multi-criteria profile queries. Moreover, we extend it to handle the minimum expected arrival time (MEAT) problem, which incorporates stochastic delays on the vehicles and asks for a set of (alternative) journeys that in its entirety minimizes the user's expected arrival time at the destination. Our experiments on the dense metropolitan network of London show that CSA computes MEAT queries, our most complex scenario, in 272 ms on average.",
